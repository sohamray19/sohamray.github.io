I love solving problems. So far, I've had experience in solving 2 kinds of problems. First, problems of scale, where it was imperative to handle incredibly
large amounts of data efficiently, reliably and swiftly. I developed this skillset in my senior year in India, when I interned at a Big Data startup.
This got me interested in other applications of data when you have the architecture in place for ingesting, storing and processing big data.
<br><br>
Thus, I was introduced to the second kind of problems, problems of learning. In my graduate degree, I have been focussing on how to solve problems of learning,
by taking on courses and projects in Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing.
<br>
<br>
To more effectively deliver solutions to large scale software engineering problems, I am also interested in principles of
object oriented design, web development, REST API's, git and scrum.

    <b><u>Software Engineering</u></b>
    <br><br>
I am a software engineer at heart. I enjoy designing, constructing and deploying software solutions.
<br>
Here's what I've done so far in the industry:
<ul>
  <br>
  <li>
  </span><a href="https://www.exadatum.com">Exadatum</a></span>: I interned at Exadatum for the second time in my senior year.
 As a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2018-25-most-sought-after-india-linkedin/">top 25 startup in India</a></span> (ranked by Linkedin), specializing in Big Data,
it was a perfect fit to my interests. Here, I learned to work with large volumes of data in an efficient and reliable fashion.
<br><br>
Particularly, <b>I built a real time, streaming, ETL (extract-transfer-load) data pipeline for data processing and analysis.</b>
The idea of the project was to build a modular pipeline that was able to ingest data from any source and process it swiftly, and reliably. In the time I spent at Exadatum, I  built a modular pipeline
that was able to ingest streaming data from Twitter, using the <b>Twitter API and Apache Flume</b> (a data connector).Once I had the data, I was feeding it to an <b>Apache Kafka</b> producer.
On the other end, I consumed the data using <b>Apache Spark</b>, before processing it and feeding it to a sentiment analysis deep learning model, to score the tweet. To do this, I fed individual tweets to the python <b>tensorflow</b> model using a Restful service.
Keep in mind, the idea of the project was to build a scalable pipeline, so the pluggable sentiment analysis model was just one of many possible ML models for the pipeline. I also built a module to simply store the data into a <b>Apache Hive</b> table.
<br><br>
Next, to make the model readily deployable, we used <b>Maven</b> as a build tool to not only ingest the data using Flume and consume it from Kafka using Spark, but also to trigger the ML model written in Python and activate the RESTful service all at once.
<br><br>
I did this in <b>Java, Scala, and Python</b>.
</li>
<br>
<li>
</span><a href="http://www.a2iot.com">ASquared IoT</a></span>: At Asquared IoT, I was working on finding an alternative solution to destructive testing for quality assurance of welded goods.
<br><br>
As a part of a team, I was able to build a web application
that recorded the sound of welding as it happened and classified it as satisfactory or defective quality. I used python <b>Flask</b> to build the web-app and connect it to the machine learning backend model. Additionally, I learned <b>frontend</b> technologies to build an interactive UI for the web-app.
<br></br>
For this project, I mostly used Python.
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b><u>Machine Learning</u></b>
<br><br>
I am deeply interested in machine learning algorithms, specifically NLP. I am also interested in scaling these algorithms to fit large datasets.
<br>
This is what I've done so far:
<ul>
  <br>
<li>
</span><a href="https://www.cybage.com">Cybage Software</a></span>: At Cybage, I was a part of the Decision Mines team, the machine learning division. Here, I built a feedback analysis system that can analyse sentiment of text, irrespective of domain.
<br><br>
It proved especially challenging to abstract the domain, since most text classification tasks are heavily dependent on context. To tackle this problem, I combined the Yelp, Amazon and Hotel Reviews datasets available online and purged the domain dependent words among them.
Next, I wrote a data preprocessing pipeline to clean, preprocess and enforce labelling on the data. However, this took tremendously long to preprocess, so I used python <b>multiprocessing</b> to speed up the process.
Finally, for sentiment analysis, I used a <b>deep learning</b> model, with <b>word embeddings</b>, and <b>LSTMs</b>. For hyperparameter tuning, I used <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> to achieve an optimal result, in minimum time.
<br><br>
Our final model improved classification accuracy by <b>11%</b> on the inplace system, and scored an accuracy of <b>80%</b> on data from un-trained domains, that is book data, kitchen appliance review data and banking data.
<br><br>
For this project, I worked with <b>python</b> and used the <b>Tensorflow</b>, <b>NLTK</b> and <b>scipy</b> libraries.
